# KastaTarning
My first C++ console app that i wrote for a programing course.

# The game

Just a simple console game, choose how many dices you want to throw and start rolling.
Everytime you roll you put your name in and that get added to a high score list.
you can then roll again to see if you can get better score or another person can roll.

There are some things missing and i hope i will have to time and knowledge to add them some time!

## TODO

* [ ] Check for unique name in list.
* [ ] Save high score list to disk.
* [ ] Add error catching.
